# Blood Runs Red

---

## Overview

**Blood Runs Red** is a co-op survival FPS set in an alternate-history 1989, where the Soviet Union launches a surprise invasion of the American Midwest. What begins as a slice-of-life summer in small-town USA quickly spirals into all-out war. Players take control of a group of recent high school graduates as they fight to survive, resist, and reclaim their home.

Built in **Unity**, with **Steamworks.Net** for multiplayer integration and **Xeno** as the modding backend, the game delivers intense combat, high-stakes decision making, and deep replayability through player-driven strategies and persistent consequences.

## Development Philosophy

**Blood Runs Red** was born from a love of gritty, systemic survival games and a fascination with "what-if" historical scenarios. It's built to empower players and modders alike to tell their own stories of rebellion, sacrifice, and survival. Whether you're defending a small-town barn or launching a risky strike on a Soviet convoy, your choices matterâ€”and they may just shape the future of your America.
