Players take control of a group of recent high school graduates as they fight to survive, resist, and reclaim their home.\nBuilt in **Unity**, with **Steamworks.Net** for multiplayer integration and **Xeno** as the modding backend, the game delivers intense combat, high-stakes decision making, and deep replayability through player-driven strategies and persistent consequences.",
