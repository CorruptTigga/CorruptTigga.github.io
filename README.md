Welcome to my GitHub Pages site. I'm **Anthony T. Lawrence**, an indie game developer and systems designer working on several simulation-driven projects.

## ðŸ”¥ Projects

- **[Echo](https://github.com/CorruptTigga/Echo)**: A Viking-era LLM-powered open-world RPG.
- **[Xeno](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/Xeno)**: A C++ embedded scripting language for modding and sandbox-safe game logic.
- **Blood Runs Red**: A private 16-player co-op FPS inspired by *Red Dawn* and *Tomorrow, When the War Began*.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Push the boundaries of simulation, emergent AI, and real-time narrative.
- Build safe and extensible systems for modders.
- Share tools, insights, and documentation with fellow devs.
