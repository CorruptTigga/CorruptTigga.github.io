## Overview

**Echo** is an ambitious Viking-era open-world narrative RPG that blends cutting-edge AI with gritty, brutal realism. It explores life in a harsh, unforgiving world where every NPC is a living, breathing agent with memories, emotions, and evolving family lines. The world does not wait for the player â€” it keeps moving, evolving, and reacting.

## Gameplay & Features

- **Living NPCs:** NPCs simulate complex emotional states, relationships, and memories, creating emergent storytelling through their interactions and decisions.  
- **Multi-Generational Simulation:** Family lines grow, evolve, and adapt over time, including pregnancy, childbirth, and mortality systems.  
- **Dynamic World:** Player-driven narrative with a reactive environment that changes based on your actions and choices.  
- **Technical Foundation:** Built in C++ with OpenGL 3.3 Core for graphics and LibTorch powering a custom Game Master LLM that guides story and NPC behavior.  
- **Text-Driven Gameplay:** Narrative commands allow deep immersion, with action markers and descriptive input guiding gameplay.  
- **No Magic:** Focused on realism, historical accuracy, and believable simulation over fantasy.
